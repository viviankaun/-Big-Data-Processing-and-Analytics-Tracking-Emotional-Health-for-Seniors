# Project Background
With an aging population, the emotional health of seniors is becoming increasingly important. Unmet emotional needs can lead to depression and other mental health issues. Our goal is to utilize AI and IoT technologies to create a platform that promotes emotional well-being through story sharing and emotional monitoring.

## Photo Collection and Story Sharing
Collect a series of photos related to seniors, which can include family moments, community events, or nature scenes.
Use these photos to tell stories that trigger seniors' memories, fostering social interaction.

## Chatbot Interaction
Design a chatbot that engages seniors in conversation, encouraging them to share their own stories and feelings.
Leverage a small language model : Ollama  to understand and generate natural language, facilitating emotion recognition and feedback on a local device.

## Emotional Monitoring
Analyze the chatbot's conversation content to identify emotional changes in seniors (e.g., happiness, sadness, anxiety).
Employ edge computing to process data on devices, allowing real-time emotion detection and reducing latency.

## Data Processing and Analysis
Utilize Apache Spark to process and analyze the collected data, including user stories and emotional feedback, generating insightful reports.
Implement Kafka as a data streaming medium to enable real-time data transmission and processing within the system.

## Expected Outcomes
Enhance seniors' emotional well-being, reducing feelings of loneliness and symptoms of depression.
Collect and analyze emotional data, providing key insights to support future research and health interventions.
Promote intergenerational communication and strengthen family and community bonds.
